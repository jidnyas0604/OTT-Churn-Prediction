🎬 Don't Let Your Subscribers Go: OTT Churn Prediction System 🎥
🚀 Overview
This project predicts customer churn for Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and more by analyzing user subscription and usage patterns. The system consists of:

A Flask-based backend API that handles user authentication and churn prediction.

A Streamlit frontend for an interactive user interface.

Users must sign up and log in to access the churn prediction feature. The system uses machine learning models such as KNN, SVM, and others to predict if a customer is likely to churn based on various features like subscription length, age, watch time, etc. 📊
